This game is a 3 dimensional voxel physics pvp game with building. The teams should be able to respond to enemy actions by building fast.

There will not be a single voxel grid; there will be many seperate grids which can be rotated seperately from each other, and have collision dynamics between them.

The game is set in space, with asteroids of many sizes. Everything should be destructable and made out of voxels. The game will not have seperate things like an "asteroid" as a single entity; an asteroid will be a collection of blocks.

The game should not have a large set of block types; most built-in stuff should be constructible from a small set of blocks. The game will have rotatable joints.

This game was originally going to have space bending, but space bending would not make the game much better, so I removed it.
